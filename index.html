            It’s a childhood I’m so thankful for. I looked up to them as examples of how to live a full life, regardless of what it throws at you. I was often in awe of the strength and perseverance it took for them to keep going when life knocked them down. My mom was in a car accident and in a coma for weeks, my Mutti was in a climbing accident that almost killed her. While my mom has broken collar bones and hips and had a mastectomy, my Mutti has suffered chronic pain her whole adult life. My Mom a divorce, my Mutti a death of a husband. Their emotional and physical pain has in no way defined who they are, but has made them stronger.

            My “injuries” are a little less obvious. They lurk in my gut and in the shadows and are easily covered up with a big smile or a perfectly timed laugh. They are the demons of anxiety and depression. They come creeping in on the best days and stomp all over me on the worst ones. They whisper lies, and shout false truths and I believe them most of the time. Those pesky buggers leave me lying on the ground, staring at the ceiling, not wanting to do this life thing anymore.

            <p>Taryn’s grandma Carol went on a bike tour in 1944 with her girlfriend Billie. We hear from Carol about the “ordinary adventure” she took at home during World War II. This episode is an opportunity to learn about what Carol’s experience was like as a woman living near Vancouver and making airplanes during the war, as well as carving out a couple of weeks for a vacation that might seem surprising to anyone who didn’t live through that time. It’s a reminder to ask our grandmothers questions because we never know what their stories might hold.</p>
        <p>My grandmother is 93 now. During World War II she was a teenager. Instead of going to university she went to work at a factory making airplanes. One summer she got a few days off so she and a female friend did a completely self-supported bike tour from their home in Vancouver BC, over to Vancouver Island and back, except that they didn’t call it a bike tour. She says they wanted to go on vacation but they didn’t have a car and gas was too expensive so they took bikes. They stayed with host families and toted all the things they would need (a change of clothes and some sandwiches) in suitcases tied to their rear racks with string.</p>

       <p>Contentment feels like a moving target and life means ever adapting to change. Although we hate the thought of shifting circumstances limiting our time outdoors, we know the reality. Jobs hold us down. Children reshape the way we spend our days. We love stories of women who continue to pursue their adventurous life even with full-time careers and children in tow. We met two mothers recently who embody that spirit whole-heartedly.</p>
       <p>Erin Rodman and Lucero Silva met on a geology field course in July 2015, and hiked the John Muir Trail together in 2016. They both travel solo regularly. This year, however, they took their daughters with them when they set off on a two-week road trip of the Southwestern U.S.</p>
            <h2>WHAT’S YOUR BACKGROUND IN THE OUTDOORS? (DID YOU GROW UP HIKING? HOW DID YOU GET INTO THIS KIND OF ADVENTURING?)</h2>
            <p><b>Erin:</b> As far as camping goes, I can only remember a couple trips as a kid.  I practically lived and breathed soccer from age 4-14, and for the most part never really thought about the outdoors. </p>
            <p><b>Lucero:</b> My parents migrated from Mexico during the early 1990’s so my exposure to family vacation, trips, or the doors wasn’t the usual tradition. My mother and father spent much of their time sustaining a finical foundation for their children</p>

   <h2><center>~~~~~~This moment was the first of many times I’d experience why I’d gone to all the trouble. I got that feeling of a gentle flow of adrenaline in my chest that I can only describe as literally feeling my heart fill up.~~~~~~</center></h2>

<center><h1>CONCLUSION</h1></center>
<p>Bionca Smith “Off the Grid with a Kid” travels with her son in a vintage Ford concession van. It’s motherhood and self-employment on the road, after she shrugged off the constraints of a more traditional lifestyle. In her zeal for a more spontaneous, connected life with her son, Bionca let go of many things—but what she gained in return is her own definition of success.</p>
